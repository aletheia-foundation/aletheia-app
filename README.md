# About

## Decentralisation
* [Decentralisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization), as stated on Wikipedia, *is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. While centralization, especially in the governmental sphere, is widely studied and practiced, there is no common definition or understanding of decentralization. The meaning of decentralization may vary in part because of the different ways it is applied. Concepts of decentralization have been applied to group dynamics and management science in private businesses and organizations, political science, law and public administration, economics and technology.*
Aletheia is technology, but using a broad definition of decentalisation rather than in a specifically technological one is a deliberate choice because Aletheia isn't *just* technology, it's also community. Decentralisation is as desirable state because it is strong. No single point of failure means itâ€™s very hard for a system to collapse through neglect or to be taken down by a malicious actor. No single point of control means the system cannot be controlled by vested interests. Utilising decentralisation is an attempt to build a truly free and incorruptible system, a system that can be applied to, but also be applied past technology.

## Why a downloadable app?
* This is one of the ways Aletheia manifests its decentralised nature, by residing on a number of inividual computers across potentially a hundred or more legal jurisdictions. If Aletheia was a web platform it would be vulnerable because a website can be blocked, a website can be taken down, the server hosting the website could be physically damaged, it can have its contents deleted or can be turned off. A website is a single point of failure. Mirroring websites can only do so much. Try turning off, deleting the contents of, or destroying hundreds of computers in hundreds of different countries, it's much harder. By the same token, control of a website could be obtained through financially acquiring the domain name, acquiring the website host, acquiring the server or the data centre it resides in. Obtaining control of hundreds of personal computers spread across the globe is much more difficult, meaning in both cases, the degree to which Aletheia can be assailed and controled by malicious actors is lowered. Decentralisation is strength.

## Ethereum
* [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) is a blockchain technology for agreeing on data and logic in a completely decentralised way. Ethereum will be used to manage rules about which documents are approved by the network. Ethereum uses [solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) smart contracts which are stored in the `/contracts` directory.

## Truffle
* [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) is a framework for developing, testing and deploying Ethereum contracts.

## Filesharing
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a peer to peer filesharing technology similar to bittorrent. A core aspect of aletheia will be a private ipfs network which shares only the files which have been approved by the community. Currently we simply use the public IPFS network to share files.

## Livenet vs Testnet vs Development
* Despite using the Ethereum code, we do not have to use the main ethereum blockchain. To keep costs down we plan on going live with a sperate blockchain.
For local development, a blockchain can be faked using [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc). For public testing a testnet is being deployed for testing interactions between multiple aletheia clients.

## Electron
* [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) is a framework for developing cross platform applications with HTML and JavaScript. `main.js` bootstraps the app, each page is then self contained within the `./app` directory. In future we may add a javascript UI framework such as react or angular.

# Requirements

* Nodejs 6+
* A running local IPFS node
* A running ethereum node. Recommended to use `testrpc` for local development and `geth` for the testnet

## OSX instructions

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/aletheia-app.git
  cd aletheia-app

  # note, this is not strictly required for local development as the fake ethereum client `testrpc` can be used.
  brew install ethereum # installs geth
  brew install ipfs
  brew install nodejs
  npm install -g electron

```

## Ubuntu instructions

These instructions were tested on ubuntu 16.10

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/aletheia-app.git
  cd aletheia-app
  # this installs nodejs 6.x, geth, ipfs and electron
  sudo ./scripts/install-ubuntu.sh
```

# Run project

Clone this repo and cd into its directory

This project requires IPFS and Ethereum clients to be running in the background

```bash
  # open three terminal tabs in the project folder:
  # in tab 1
  npm install
  npm run ethereum-local

  # in tab 2 (must be in project directory)
  npm run ipfs-local

  # in tab 3 (must be in project directory)
  npm start # (app will start but be unable to connect to filesharing or blockchain)
```

Note: The video mentions installing/running the project on Mac OS. The steps followed in the video are also applicable to any Linux distribution (Ubuntu, CentOS, ...). 


# Tests
Tests require IPFS and Ethereum clients to be running in the background
```bash
  # while `npm run ethereum-local` and `npm run ethereum-local` are running in two other tabs:
  npm test
```

# Testnet
Todo: add instructions for testnet

# code style
Project uses the Javascript standard style
